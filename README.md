# LyricFusion-AI-Powered-Lyrics-Generator

This Streamlit app leverages a Markov Chain model to create a dynamic lyrics generator using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The code utilizes pandas for data manipulation, where it loads a dataset of song lyrics and processes the text into word sequences. By employing a Markov Chain, it analyzes these sequences and learns how words typically follow one another in the lyrics. The model is trained to predict the most likely next word based on the given input, using n-grams (in this case, bigrams) to understand word patterns. This foundational NLP technique helps generate lyrics that resemble the style and structure of the original songs in the dataset.

The app is built using Streamlit, a powerful yet easy-to-use framework for creating interactive web applications directly in Python. The app interface is simple: users enter a seed text, which serves as the starting point for the lyrics generation. When the "Generate Lyrics" button is clicked, the Markov Chain model processes the input and generates a sequence of words that continues the seed text. The generated lyrics are then displayed on the webpage, providing a seamless way for users to experiment with different seed texts and explore how the model builds lyrics in real-time.

This project demonstrates the effective use of machine learning for text generation and highlights the simplicity of deploying AI models using Streamlit. By combining NLP with interactive web technologies, the app not only showcases the potential of Markov Chains in creating human-like lyrics but also illustrates how easily data-driven models can be integrated into user-friendly applications. The use of Streamlit ensures that anyone, from data scientists to non-technical users, can engage with the model and gain insights into how AI understands and replicates natural language patterns.
